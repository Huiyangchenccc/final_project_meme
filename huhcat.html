        <h2>
            Bender the Huh Cat
        </h2>
        <p id="huhcat">
            In a quiet corner of Tecoma, a small town nestled in the foothills 35km east of Melbourne, lived a
            73-year-old woman named Nelie Cage. Her home was a modest, ivy-wrapped unit filled with plants, old books,
            and one very unusual companion: a white cat named Bender.<br><br>

            Bender wasn’t your average cat. At 15 years old, he had seen things — things no feline should ever have to
            process. His fur was soft and snowy, but it was his face that made him legendary. Head always slightly
            tilted, mouth ever so slightly open, Bender looked perpetually stunned — like he had
            just overheard the wildest gossip of his life and was still trying to process it.<br><br>

            “Huh?”<br>
            That was the vibe.<br><br>

            Nelie swore he’d been like that since kittenhood. “He came out the box lookin’ like he’d seen a ghost,”
            she’d laugh to neighbors. “Or like he just found out I used to be a roller disco champion.”<br><br>

            Despite his expression, Bender lived a peaceful, slightly dramatic life. He’d stare blankly at the wall for
            hours, then suddenly bolt down the hallway like he'd just remembered a long-forgotten appointment.
            Neighborhood kids loved him, often stopping by just to take selfies with his confused little face.
